# Simple linear regression example in R

This is a simple linear regression example implemented in R. 

## Description

This is an R implementation of the spreadsheet linear regression example shown on the Angie Teaches YouTube channel. It will calculate the regression equation, R^2, and generate a plot of the regression line.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* You will need to install R, perhaps R Studio (which I used) and the `ggplot2` R library.

### Installing

* Upload the `regression.R` program to your working directory.
* In your local working directory be sure to install the ggplot2 library

```
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

### Executing program

* Set your local working directory
* Use the source command to run the program

```
source("regression.R")
```
